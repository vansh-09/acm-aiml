basically,

Supervised learning is that we have data which is labelled and we have to predict outcomes for newer data
eg: House Price Prediction

in Unsupervised learning, data is not labelled and we have to find patterns
eg: customer segmentation by their behaviour

in Reinforcement Learning, an agent interacts with an environment and teaches it by trial and error while giving feedbacks
eg: chess AI
